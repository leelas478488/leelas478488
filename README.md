Sure, here's a step-by-step approach along with some example code using Google Cloud services:

1. **Setup Google Cloud Project:**
   - Create a new project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
   - Enable necessary APIs like Cloud Speech-to-Text, Cloud Text-to-Speech, and Cloud Storage.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather a dataset containing samples of human voice recordings and AI-generated voice recordings. You can use resources like Google Dataset Search or create your own dataset.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocess the audio data to ensure consistency in format, sample rate, and length. You may need to convert different audio formats to a standard format.

4. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract relevant features from the audio data. For voice comparison, you can use techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which capture the characteristics of the voice.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., deep learning model using TensorFlow) to classify whether the input audio is human or AI-generated.
   - Split your dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Define your model architecture, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
   - Train the model using the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Once you have a trained model, deploy it on Google Cloud Platform. You can use services like AI Platform or Cloud Functions depending on your requirements.

7. **Integration with Google Cloud Services:**
   - Integrate your model with Google Cloud services like Cloud Speech-to-Text for converting audio to text and vice versa.
   - You can use Google Cloud Storage to store your audio files and other resources.

8. **Building the Solution:**
   - Create a program/script that takes an audio file as input, extracts features, and feeds them into the trained model to predict whether it's human or AI-generated.
   - Utilize Google Cloud APIs to convert the audio to text (if needed) and perform the necessary comparisons.

Here's a simple Python code example for training a basic deep learning model using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define your model architecture
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(num_mfcc, )), 
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)), 
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'), 
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)), 
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'), 
    layers.Flatten(), 
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'), 
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adjust the architecture and parameters based on your specific dataset and requirements. Additionally, you'll need to replace `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test` with your actual training and testing data.
